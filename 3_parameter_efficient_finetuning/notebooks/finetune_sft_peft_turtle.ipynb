    "# How to Fine-Tune LLMs with LoRA Adapters using Hugging Face TRL\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to efficiently fine-tune large language models using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters. LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that:\n",
    "- Freezes the pre-trained model weights\n",
    "- Adds small trainable rank decomposition matrices to attention layers\n",
    "- Typically reduces trainable parameters by ~90%\n",
    "- Maintains model performance while being memory efficient\n",

    "1. Setup development environment and LoRA configuration\n",
    "2. Create and prepare the dataset for adapter training\n",
    "3. Fine-tune using `trl` and `SFTTrainer` with LoRA adapters\n",
